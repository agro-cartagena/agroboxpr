# Components

This folder will contain all of the custom React Native components the application will use.
<br>

For each component, there will be one folder with 2 files:
<ol>
    <li> A file to hold the component's structure.
    <li> A file to hold the component's stylesheet.
</ol>

Inside the component structure file, the stylesheet file shall be imported at the beginning statements. 

This way, the component's structure and aesthetics are decoupled, making it easier to debug and maintain.
