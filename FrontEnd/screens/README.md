# Screens

This folder will contain all of the screens, or views, the application will display.
<br>

For each screen, there will be one folder with 2 files:
<ol>
    <li> A file to hold the screen's structure.
    <li> A file to hold the screen's stylesheet.
</ol>

Inside the screen structure file, the stylesheet file shall be imported at the beginning statements. 

This way, the screen's structure and aesthetics are decoupled, making it easier to debug and maintain.
