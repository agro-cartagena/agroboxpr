# Services

This folder will contain all of the network services (http logic) the application will use.
<br>

Each file corresponds to one particular service that may be usable throughout various components.

This to comply with the Single Responsability Principle, and to increase modularity through the codebase.

This way, the component and its logic are decoupled, making it easier to debug and maintain.
